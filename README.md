# Psoriasis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that causes red, itchy, and scaly patches on the skin. It generally occurs when your immune system gets hyperactive and attacks healthy skin cells, causing faster cell growth and the buildup of plaques on the skin.

It is a common disease with no cure, but homeopathic medication and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms.

## What is Psoriasis?

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the skin, instead of shedding normally, rapidly builds up on the surface, looking like plaques. This often happens due to a dysfunctional immune system that attacks healthy skin cells, causing inflammation and rough patches. These patches can appear anywhere but are commonly found on knees, elbows, palms, faces, backs, scalps, and feet.

## Symptoms of Psoriasis

* Scaly, swollen plaques on the skin, typically on the knees, lower back, elbows, arms, palms, scalp, and feet.
* On people with skin of colour, these patches look dark and thick, such as dark brown, greyish, or purple
* On Caucasian people, the patches look red, inflamed, with white scales
* Dry, cracked skin, which may bleed
* Swelling, itching, and burning skin
* A cycle of rashes that flare up and eventually subside in a few weeks
* Pus-filled blisters or bumps
* Skin peeling
* Nail pitting, discoloration, or detachment from the nail bed
* Swollen and painful joints, referred to as psoriatic arthritis

Symptoms will differ for every person. Typically, the symptoms appear from the teenage years up to 25 years. Kids, men, or women – anyone can get psoriasis.

## Causes of Psoriasis

Normal skin cells grow and eventually shed within 1 month. But psoriasis leads to rapid turnover of cells deep under the skin, which appear on the surface in just a few days, leading to abnormal buildup.

The main cause of psoriasis remains unknown. Yet researchers believe that it can be due to genes, dysfunctional immune function, triggers, and environmental factors.

The following factors trigger most types of psoriasis:

* Skin injuries, burns, or cuts
* Stress
* Allergies
* Unhealthy diet
* Dry, cold weather
* Viral or bacterial infections like upper respiratory infections or strep throat, and HIV infection
* Medications such as NSAIDs, beta-blockers, lithium, antimalarial drugs, and other antibiotics
* Obesity
* Smoking or inhaling second-hand smoke
* Alcohol
* Sunburns

Inflammation due to psoriasis may also affect other organs in the body, hence, it is important to manage the symptoms and seek medical attention when necessary.

## Types of Psoriasis

Different types of psoriasis are as follows:

* Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it causes rough, itchy plaques on the skin, typically on the scalp, lower back, knees, and elbows.
* Guttate Psoriasis looks like small, scaly, red droplet-shaped lesions that may appear on the skin after a streptococcal infection (strep throat). It often affects young people and kids.
* Inverse Psoriasis occurs in skin folds of the chest, buttocks, and genital areas. It appears like smooth, inflamed plaques with no scaling, and it worsens with sweat and friction. This psoriasis may occur due to fungal infections.
* Erythrodermic Psoriasis is a rare yet severe condition that causes inflammation, rashes, and shedding of nearly 90% of your skin. It can cause intense burning or itching sensations.
* Pustular Psoriasis is a rare condition where small, pus-filled bumps appear over patches.
* Nail Psoriasis causes abnormal changes to the structure of your fingernails and toenails, such as discoloration or crumbling. Sometimes the nail plate may completely fall off.
* Sebopsoriasis is a condition where rough plaques appear on the scalp and face with yellowish scales. It is a combination of seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.

## Complications of Psoriasis

Psoriasis may lead to other health conditions caused due to inflammation in the body, such as:

* Psoriatic arthritis (joint swelling and pain)
* Metabolic syndrome
* High blood pressure
* Cardiovascular diseases
* Type 2 diabetes
* Depression and anxiety
* Skin discoloration
* Eye diseases such as uveitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis

Other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease, Celiac disease, Sclerosis, and more.

## Homeopathic Treatment for Psoriasis

Homeopathy takes a holistic approach in treating psoriasis, taking unique symptoms of each patient into account, and personalizing the course of treatment for them. Homeopathic medication targets the root cause and triggers of the disease, such as inflammation, to reduce the psoriasis outbreak and reduce the recurrence of symptoms.

Moreover, it also works to improve overall skin health and help patients live stress-free lives.

Psoriasis patients need to consult an expert Homeopathic Doctor to ensure the treatment plan suits their symptoms without causing any side effects.
